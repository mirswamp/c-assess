This is the SWAMP (Software Assurance Markeplace) C/C++ Framework repository.

Buliding a release of this framework requires the SWAMP framework dependencies
directory.  To make a release run the following commands:

    mkdir -p <output-dir>
    export SWAMP_FRAMEWORK_DEPENDENCIES=<path-to-swamp-framekwork-dependencies>
    util/make_swamp_release <output-dir> <version>

This will create the c-assess-<version>.tar.gz framework archive.
